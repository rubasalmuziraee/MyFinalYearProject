# Face Detection Technique

## About the Project
This project focuses on developing a system for detecting human faces in images using Machine Learning (ML). Our goal was to achieve high accuracy in face detection based on pre-trained classifiers and a machine learning software library.

## Why Machine Learning (ML)?
Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, involves developing algorithms that learn from data, automatically detect patterns, and make predictions based on those patterns. For face detection, we used the Haar Cascade algorithm, which effectively analyzes and separates faces from other features in an image.

## Motivation & Problem Statement
Sensitive systems, such as security applications, require highly accurate face detection processes. The main motivation for this project is to provide a reliable, high-accuracy detection system that can be integrated into sensitive applications to improve performance and dependability.

## Goals and Objectives
1. Review existing studies on face detection methods using OpenCV classifiers.
2. Develop a suitable and accurate system for face detection.
3. Detect faces using OpenCV.
4. Implement face detection with a pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier for faces and eyes.
